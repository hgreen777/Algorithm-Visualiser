# Algorithm-Visualiser
Visualise Sort &amp; Search Algorithms. [Python][Pygame]

BEWARE!! DO NOT HAVE VOLUME SET TO A HIGH LEVEL!!!
THE SOUND USED IS NOT PLEASENT SO TURN VOLUME DOWN!!!

# üßæ Features
- Select an algorithm
- Play/Stop an algorithm
- Show the current state of the array [algorithm]
- Show the cursor (pointer) position

# üßë‚Äçüè´ Usage
- To change the algorithm, array size, framerate or/and screen size, edit the variable in Algorithm_Visualiser.
- The green button will stop the algorithm if an algorithm is in progress. 
- If no algorithm is in process, it will be reset (ie re-shuffled and sort started again from beginning)
- Ensure if algorithm requires a sorted algorithm, this option is set to "True" else this could break the program.

Algorithms that require a sorted array:
- Binary Search
- Jump Search 
- Exponential Binary Search
- Fibonacci search
